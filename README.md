This repository contains several different pieces. First, there are 3 CSV files that represent data pulled from the website. There is 1 python file that contains the code to clean and merge the CSV's and then run sentiment analysis. There are also 2 text files, one reporting the top 5 and bottom 5 companies in terms of sentiment score, and one detailing observations made about the sentiment analysis.
