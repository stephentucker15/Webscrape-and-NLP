There were a few observations I noticed when looking at the sentiment scores of these websites. First, many of the sentiment scores were 0.
I think this has to do with the way that some of the websites worded their descriptions. While certain sites used key words like "optimize"
or "killer", others used very non-positive or negative language, leading to scores of 0. This leads me into my next observation, which 
relates to those key words. Several of the purposes with the highest sentiment score included a couple of highly positive words like 
"optimize" or "innovative". Meanwhile some of the purposes with the most negative sentiment score included the word "killer". In these 
descriptions, it is unlikely that the website actually meant to use the term in the negative way that the sentiment score is interpreting.
It looks like "killer" was actually meant in an ironic tone, meaning positive, but the NLP tool won't pick up on that.
